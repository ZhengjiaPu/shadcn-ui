## Examples

### With text

The CheckboxWithText component combines a checkbox with accompanying text, making it ideal for scenarios where users need to acknowledge terms or policies. The checkbox aligns with a label and a descriptive note, providing a clear, accessible interface. The label is linked to the checkbox for easy selection, and the additional text gives users context, such as references to terms or privacy policies. This setup is perfect for forms or agreements, where clarity and user consent are essential. The component also includes styling for disabled states, maintaining usability and a consistent visual design.

<ComponentPreview
  name="checkbox-with-text"
  description="A checkbox with label and description."
/>

### Disabled

The CheckboxDisabled component is a checkbox paired with a label that indicates terms acceptance but is set to a disabled state. This setup visually communicates to users that the option is currently unavailable or not selectable. The label and checkbox are styled with reduced opacity and a “not-allowed” cursor, making it clear that interaction is restricted. This component is useful in forms where certain options may only be available based on user actions or conditions, maintaining clarity and accessibility while guiding user behavior.

### Form

The CheckboxForm component combines both single and multiple checkbox options within a single form, leveraging React Hook Form and Zod for streamlined validation. This versatile component allows for individual checkbox options, like selecting mobile-specific settings, as well as multiple checkbox selections, such as choosing items to display in a sidebar. Each checkbox is associated with labels and descriptions for clarity, enhancing user guidance. The form enforces validation, ensuring that users select at least one item when required. Upon submission, the form triggers a toast notification, displaying the selected values in JSON format to provide immediate feedback. The CheckboxForm component is ideal for customizable settings and preferences, where both single and multiple selections need to be managed with user-friendly, interactive feedback.
