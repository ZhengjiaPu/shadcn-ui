## Introduction

The Combobox component is a versatile input element that merges the functionality of a text input with a dropdown list, allowing users to either select a predefined option or enter a custom value. This component is particularly useful for fields with a large set of possible options, as it provides a streamlined and space-efficient way to present choices without overwhelming the user. By offering both selection and input capabilities, the Combobox enhances flexibility and user experience, commonly applied in forms, search interfaces, and filters where type-ahead suggestions improve interaction efficiency.

## Demo

<ComponentPreview name="combobox-demo" />

## Installation

The Combobox is built using a composition of the `<Popover />` and the `<Command />` components.

See installation instructions for the [Popover](/docs/components/popover#installation) and the [Command](/docs/components/command#installation) components.

## Usage

```tsx
"use client"

      <PopoverTrigger asChild>
        <Button
          variant="outline"

          className="w-[200px] justify-between"
        >
          {value
            ? frameworks.find((framework) => framework.value === value)?.label

          <CommandInput placeholder="Search framework..." />
          <CommandList>
            <CommandEmpty>No framework found.</CommandEmpty>
            <CommandGroup>
              {frameworks.map((framework) => (
                <CommandItem
                  key={framework.value}
                  value={framework.value}
                  onSelect={(currentValue) => {
                    setValue(currentValue === value ? "" : currentValue)
                    setOpen(false)
                  }}
                >
                  <Check
                    className={cn(
                      "mr-2 h-4 w-4",
                      value === framework.value ? "opacity-100" : "opacity-0"
                    )}
                  />
                  {framework.label}
                </CommandItem>
              ))}
            </CommandGroup>

## Variants

### Combobox

The Combobox variant is the standard version, providing a combined input and dropdown selection field that allows users to type or select from a list of options. This variant is ideal for cases where users need the flexibility to either enter a custom value or quickly choose from predefined options.

<ComponentPreview name="combobox-demo" />

### Popover

The Popover variant of the Combobox provides a pop-up list of options that appears when the input is focused. This style is useful for scenarios where screen space is limited, allowing the list to appear only when needed and minimizing distraction.

<ComponentPreview name="combobox-popover" />

### Dropdown menu

The Dropdown Menu variant is designed to present options in a classic dropdown menu format, making it ideal for interfaces that need a more traditional look and feel. This variant ensures that users can easily navigate through options in a structured dropdown layout.

<ComponentPreview name="combobox-dropdown-menu" />

### Responsive

The Responsive variant adapts the Combobox to different screen sizes, using a `<Popover />` component on desktop and switching to a `<Drawer />` component on mobile. This approach ensures optimal usability by providing a compact experience on mobile and a convenient popover on larger screens.

<ComponentPreview name="combobox-responsive" />

### Form

The Form variant is tailored for use within form layouts, allowing seamless integration with other form fields and validation styles. This variant is particularly useful for forms requiring dynamic inputs, such as search fields or filtered selection options.
