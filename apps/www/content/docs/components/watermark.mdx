## Introduction

The Watermark component is a semi-transparent overlay applied to content such as images, documents, or videos to indicate ownership, protect intellectual property, or add subtle branding. It typically consists of text or a logo positioned in a fixed location or repeated across the content, ensuring visibility without obstructing the main content. Commonly used in digital media, the Watermark component helps deter unauthorized use while reinforcing brand identity, making it a valuable tool for protecting and personalizing digital assets in various applications.
