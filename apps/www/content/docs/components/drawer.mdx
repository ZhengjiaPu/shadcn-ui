## Introduction

The Drawer component is a sliding panel that appears from the side of the screen, providing a convenient way to display additional content or navigation options without leaving the current page. Itâ€™s commonly used for menus, filters, or detailed information, making it easy for users to access supplementary content while staying focused on the main view. The Drawer component is customizable, with options for different slide-in directions, animations, and overlay styles. It supports flexible positioning and content customization, allowing developers to adjust it for various application needs. This component is especially useful for mobile interfaces and responsive designs, providing an intuitive, space-efficient way to enhance user interaction.

This setup optimizes user experience across screen sizes, allowing seamless profile editing with consistent functionality. Ideal for forms or quick settings adjustments, it adapts smoothly to both desktop and mobile views.
