## Introduction

The `Accordion` component is a versatile, interactive UI element designed to organize content into collapsible sections, allowing users to navigate through information efficiently. This component supports single-item expansion, ensuring only one panel is open at a time, while also allowing users to toggle each item individually. Each Accordion section includes a trigger and content area, making it ideal for FAQs, lists, or any structured content that benefits from progressive disclosure. Built with accessibility in mind, the Accordion follows the WAI-ARIA design patterns and includes default animations and styles, creating a smooth, visually cohesive experience across applications.

## Variants

The `AccordionButton` variant is ideal for use in onboarding guides, help sections,
or multi-step instructions where users need quick actions within expandable content.
Each accordion section can reveal detailed information or steps, and the button inside
triggers a toast notification for immediate feedback, keeping users informed as they
interact. This setup suits scenarios requiring a clear, guided flow with interactive
elements, enhancing user engagement and comprehension in complex processes.{" "}

### accordion

with picture and button

<ComponentPreview
  name="accordion-picture-button"
  className="[&_.preview>[data-orientation=vertical]]:sm:max-w-[70%]"
  description="An accordion with three items"
/>
The `AccordionPictureButton` variant is designed for interactive content that includes
images, text, and actionable buttons within expandable sections. Ideal for use in
tutorials, product descriptions, or information-rich guides, each accordion item
can contain an image that toggles between zoomed and normal view on click, providing
a detailed visual experience. A button in each section triggers a toast notification
for instant feedback, enhancing user interaction. This component is perfect for scenarios
that require clear, step-by-step visuals and responsive actions to guide users through
complex or detailed information.{" "}

### accordion with list

<ComponentPreview
  name="accordion-list"
  className="[&_.preview>[data-orientation=vertical]]:sm:max-w-[70%]"
  description="An accordion with three items"
/>
The `AccordionList` variant is a structured, interactive accordion designed for presenting
categorized lists, such as campus locations or faculty departments. Each section
expands to display a table of clickable items. When an item is clicked, a toast notification
appears with the selected item’s name, providing immediate feedback. This component
is ideal for directories, listings, or informational pages where users can explore
various categories and receive real-time responses to their selections, making it
particularly suitable for academic or organizational settings where structured information
is essential.

### accordion with list and avatar

<ComponentPreview
  name="accordion-list-avatar"

The accordion with list and avatar is an interactive directory designed for displaying
information about individuals in expandable sections. Each accordion item (e.g.,
"Albanese Ministry" and "Shadow Ministry") contains a list of officials with their
respective roles, names, and profile avatars. Clicking on an entry opens a dialog
with a detailed profile view, including an image and description.

Key Features:
Structured Information: Organizes profiles into categories, making it easy for users to navigate through sections.
Dialog Display: Each entry opens a dialog on click, providing an in-depth view of the person’s role and responsibilities.
Visual and Interactive Elements: Incorporates avatars for quick identification, and dialog interactions for more detailed information.
