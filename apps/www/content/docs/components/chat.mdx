This component includes a preloaded message history, real-time message input, and dynamic rendering of sent and received messages. Messages are visually distinguished with customizable styling for clarity and user focus. The `Chat` component also integrates feedback mechanisms using a toast notification system to confirm message sending, enhancing the user experience. With responsive design elements and accessible form handling, `Chat` is well-suited for use in support systems, social interactions, or any context requiring a user-friendly chat feature.
