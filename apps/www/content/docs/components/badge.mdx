## Introduction

The Badge component is a small, versatile indicator that can be used to convey information such as status, count, or other contextual data. Commonly placed on icons, buttons, or list items, badges provide a quick visual cue for users to notice updates, alerts, or numerical values. They are customizable in terms of color, size, and content, making them a flexible tool to enhance the user interface and improve the user experience. Badges are frequently used in notifications, item counts, and highlighting specific statuses within applications.

## Usage

```tsx
import { Badge } from "@/components/ui/badge"
```

```tsx
<Badge variant="outline">Badge</Badge>
```

### Link

You can use the `badgeVariants` helper to create a link that looks like a badge.

```tsx
import { badgeVariants } from "@/components/ui/badge"
```

```tsx
<Link className={badgeVariants({ variant: "outline" })}>Badge</Link>
```

## Variants

### Default Badge

The Default Badge variant is the primary version of the Badge component, often used to display notifications, statuses, or other informational highlights. This badge provides a solid background color that helps it stand out, making it suitable for drawing attention to important elements in the UI.

<ComponentPreview name="badge-demo" description="A badge" />

---

### Secondary Badge

The Secondary Badge variant uses a softer, secondary color, making it ideal for scenarios where a less prominent indicator is required. This variant is useful for displaying supplementary information or statuses that do not need to be as visually dominant as the default badge.

<ComponentPreview
  name="badge-secondary"
  description="A badge using secondary as variant."
/>

---

### Outline Badge

The Outline Badge variant features a border around the badge with a transparent or white background. This style is perfect for minimalistic designs where subtlety is preferred, providing a less intrusive way to convey information without drawing too much attention.

<ComponentPreview
  name="badge-outline"
  description="A badge using outline as variant."
/>

---

### Destructive Badge

The Destructive Badge variant is used to signal warnings, errors, or destructive actions. With a bold, often red color, this badge clearly indicates elements that require caution or attention, making it suitable for situations involving deletions, alerts, or other critical actions.

<ComponentPreview name="badge-destructive" description="A destructive badge." />
