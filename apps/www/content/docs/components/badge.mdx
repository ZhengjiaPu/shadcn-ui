## Introduction

The Badge component is a small, versatile indicator that can be used to convey information such as status, count, or other contextual data. Commonly placed on icons, buttons, or list items, badges provide a quick visual cue for users to notice updates, alerts, or numerical values. They are customizable in terms of color, size, and content, making them a flexible tool to enhance the user interface and improve the user experience. Badges are frequently used in notifications, item counts, and highlighting specific statuses within applications.
