## Introduction

The Aspect Ratio component ensures that media elements such as images, videos, and containers maintain a specified width-to-height ratio regardless of screen size or parent container dimensions. This helps in creating responsive layouts by preserving the aspect ratio across different devices and orientations, providing a consistent and visually appealing user experience. The component is highly customizable, allowing you to define the desired ratio and easily integrate it with other UI elements.
