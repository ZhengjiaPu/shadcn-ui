## Introduction

The `Button` component is an essential interactive UI element designed to trigger actions, navigate users, or perform specific tasks. It is a highly customizable element that can adapt to various design requirements, supporting multiple styles like primary, secondary, and outline. Built with accessibility in mind, the Button follows the standards to ensure usability across applications. In the `Demo`, a toast notification is triggered on button click, providing immediate feedback to the user.

## Demo

### Usage

To use the basic `Button` component from our library in your React application, follow these steps for a practical, real-world implementation:

#### Step 1: Install the shadcn Component Library

If you haven’t set up shadcn components in your project, add it by running:

```shell
npx shadcn-ui@latest add button toast
```

#### Step 2: Import the Button Component

In the file where you want to use the button (e.g., `App.js` or `Form.js`), import it from the library:

```javascript
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
```

#### Step 3: Using the Button with Toast Notification

Here’s an example use case where a button triggers a toast notification on click, providing immediate feedback to the user.

```javascript
import React from "react"

import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import { ToastAction, Toaster } from "@/components/ui/toast"
import { useToast } from "@/components/ui/use-toast"

const ButtonDemo = () => {
  const { toast } = useToast()

  const handleClick = () => {
    toast({
      description: "Button clicked!",
      action: <ToastAction altText="Goto schedule to undo">Undo</ToastAction>,
    })
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <Toaster />
      <Button
        variant="outline"
        className="bg-orange-600 text-white hover:bg-orange-700 focus:ring-orange-600"
        onClick={handleClick}
      >
        Click me
      </Button>
    </div>
  )
}

export default ButtonDemo
```

#### Explanation

- **Toast Notification**: The `toast` function is called on button click, displaying a message to inform the user that the button was clicked.
- **Immediate Feedback**: The `ToastAction` provides an option to "Undo" the action, offering additional interactivity.
- **Custom Styling**: The button uses custom classes to have an orange background with white text, turning a darker orange on hover for visual feedback.

#### Customizing the Button

In a real application, you might want the `Button` to match your branding or a specific design. The `Button` component allows easy customization with props for size, color, and variant (e.g., `variant="outline"`), letting you adapt it to different scenarios, like a “Cancel” button with secondary styling or a larger “Submit” button in primary styling.

## Variants

### Primary Button

<ComponentPreview name="button-demo" description="A button in primary style" />
The Primary Button is used for main actions, capturing user attention for critical
tasks. Its bold styling differentiates it from other UI elements, making it an ideal
choice for primary actions in forms or call-to-action sections.

### Secondary Button

<ComponentPreview
  name="button-secondary"
  description="A button in secondary style"
/>
The Secondary Button is less prominent than the Primary Button and is commonly used
for supplementary actions. It visually supports the primary action, allowing users
to perform alternative tasks or navigate secondary choices.

### Destructive Button

<ComponentPreview
  name="button-destructive"
  description="A button in destructive style"
/>
The Destructive Button is typically used for actions that have significant consequences,
like deletions. Its distinctive color signals caution, helping users to understand
the potential impact of their action.

### Outline Button

<ComponentPreview
  name="button-outline"
  description="A button in outline style"
/>
The Outline Button provides a subtler visual style with only a border, making it
suitable for less prominent actions where visual weight needs to be minimized, such
as in toolbars or secondary options.

### Ghost Button

<ComponentPreview name="button-ghost" description="A button in ghost style" />
The Ghost Button is minimalistic, with no solid fill or border, blending well with
backgrounds. This button is ideal for actions that are low-priority or when used
in dense UI layouts.

### Link Button

<ComponentPreview name="button-link" description="A button in link style" />
The Link Button mimics the appearance of a hyperlink, directing users to related
pages or content without requiring a traditional button interface. It’s useful for
inline navigation within text or cards.

### Icon Button

<ComponentPreview name="button-icon" description="A button with an icon only" />
The Icon Button is compact, designed for actions where space is limited, such as
toolbars or compact UI elements. Its concise design helps users quickly recognize
actions by icon.

### Button with Icon

<ComponentPreview
  name="button-with-icon"
  description="A button with text and an icon"
/>
A Button with Icon provides a blend of icon and text for improved usability, offering
additional context to users. Ideal for scenarios requiring quick action recognition
alongside descriptive labels.

### Loading Button

<ComponentPreview
  name="button-loading"
  description="A button with a loading indicator"
/>
The Loading Button indicates processing status for actions that require time to complete,
keeping users informed about ongoing tasks, which enhances user experience and reduces
uncertainty.

### As Child

<ComponentPreview
  name="button-as-child"
  description="A button wrapping a custom Link component"
/>
The As Child variant allows nesting components like links within the Button. It maintains
Button styling while incorporating navigational or interactive elements, increasing
versatility.
