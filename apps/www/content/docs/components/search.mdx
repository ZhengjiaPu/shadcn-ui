## Introduction

The `Search` component is an interactive UI element designed to allow users to quickly find content by typing keywords into a search field. It provides real-time feedback through a toast notification once the search is initiated and validates user input to ensure at least two characters are entered. This component is ideal for applications where content discovery and keyword-based search functionality are essential. Built with accessibility and user experience in mind, the Search component adheres to modern design principles, offering clear input validation messages and actionable feedback.

## Demo

<ComponentPreview
  name="search-demo"
  className="[&_.preview>[data-orientation=vertical]]:sm:max-w-[70%]"
  description="search demo"
/>
This `demo` provides a user-friendly interface where users can input keywords to
perform a search. If the entered text is less than two characters, a red validation
message appears beneath the input field, prompting the user to "Enter at least 2
characters." Upon entering a valid query and clicking the search button, a toast
notification is displayed with the entered keyword, confirming the search initiation.
The search action redirects users to a Google Search results page pre-populated with
the query, offering a seamless and intuitive experience.{" "}

The `RadixSearch` component provides an interactive search input field with a search
button, designed to handle user queries efficiently while providing immediate feedback
via toast notifications. When a user clicks the search button:

If the input field is empty, a destructive toast notification appears with an error message, prompting the user to fill in the required content.
If a valid search query is entered (at least one non-whitespace character), a toast notification confirms the initiation of the search and displays the search term.
The component visually organizes content using a flex layout and ensures accessibility with focus ring styling for the input field.
This component supports real-time feedback, error handling, and a clean user experience, making it ideal for scenarios where immediate user input validation and feedback are required. Variations can include changes to toast styles, input placeholder text, or additional search handling logic.
