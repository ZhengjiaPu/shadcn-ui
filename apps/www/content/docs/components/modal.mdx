## Introduction

The `Modal` component provides a flexible interface for displaying critical information, confirmations, forms, or images in a centered overlay. This component includes several variants, each designed for different use cases such as login, confirmation, and informational modals. Built with accessibility in mind, it follows WAI-ARIA design patterns and includes custom animations for smooth opening and closing interactions.
