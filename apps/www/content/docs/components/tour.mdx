## Introduction

The Tour component is an interactive guide designed to help users navigate through an application by highlighting key features and providing contextual information step-by-step. Often used in onboarding experiences, the Tour component walks users through essential functionalities, making it easier for them to understand and engage with the interface. It typically consists of a series of tooltips or modals that direct attention to different elements, enhancing the user experience by providing clear guidance and reducing the learning curve for new users.
