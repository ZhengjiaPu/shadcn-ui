## Introduction

The Command component is a fast, composable, and unstyled command menu designed specifically for React. It utilizes the cmdk library, breaking down command functionality into modular components, enabling developers to build a flexible command menu by combining various subcomponents. With accessibility in mind, this component supports keyboard navigation and is highly customizable, making it ideal for creating dynamic search, command input, and various interaction scenarios.

## About

The `<Command />` component uses the [`cmdk`](https://cmdk.paco.me) component by [pacocoursey](https://twitter.com/pacocoursey).

## Variants

### Normal command

The `CommandDemo` component provides a user-friendly command interface, ideal for
applications needing quick access to common actions or settings. This command menu
could be effectively used in scenarios like productivity apps, project management
tools, or educational platforms, where users frequently need to access or search
through various commands or features. When a user starts typing in the `CommandInput`
field, the list dynamically filters items based on the input, showing only relevant
commands. Selecting a command (by clicking or using keyboard navigation) triggers
the corresponding action, while a disabled command like "Calculator" is non-interactive
and cannot be selected. If no results match the input, a "No results found" message
appears. This interactive command interface provides a streamlined and accessible
way to perform various actions within the application.

### Dialog

The `CommandDialog` provides a responsive command dialog, activated by pressing âŒ˜
+ J (or Ctrl + J on Windows). This dialog allows users to quickly access features
or settings, making it ideal for applications requiring frequent navigation or multitasking
support, such as productivity suites, note-taking apps, or dashboard interfaces.
Upon pressing the shortcut, the `CommandDialog` opens, allowing users to start typing
in the CommandInput field to filter options. Selecting an item, either by clicking
or navigating with the keyboard, triggers the corresponding command. If no items
match the input, a "No results found" message appears. This dialog streamlines user
interactions, enabling quick access to essential features without leaving the main
interface.

To show the command menu in a dialog, use the `<CommandDialog />` component.

### Combobox

You can use the `<Command />` component as a combobox. See the [Combobox](/docs/components/combobox) page for more information.
