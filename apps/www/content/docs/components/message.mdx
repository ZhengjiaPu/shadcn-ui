## Introduction

The Message component is designed to provide users with important information through visually distinct messages. It supports several types, including `normal`, `duration`, `error`, `success`, and `warning`, each with custom icons, styles, and durations to fit different use cases. Messages are dismissible and can be controlled to appear and disappear as needed.
